Logspot also supports code syntax highlighting as well

![codeblocks](/codeblocks.png)

```js{1,3-5}[server.js]
// Javascript
const url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/";
async function fetchPosts() {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  console.log(response);
}
```

Currently this is only supported for the following languages, to keep the bundle small for this demo.

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Markdown
- TypeScript
- Vue
- Python
- Ruby

You can always add your own languages to the `highlight` array in the `nuxt.config.js` file.

Support for inline code blocks is also available example `const name = "John Doe"`{lang="js"}

Shiki also supports different themes for codeblocks, you can learn mode about them [here](https://content.nuxtjs.org/api/configuration/#highlight)
